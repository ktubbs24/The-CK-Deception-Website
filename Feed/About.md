### About this Site 


Your notes about Charlie Kirk are primarily found in three recordings where you discuss him extensively. In these notes, you express strong theological disagreements with Charlie Kirk's teachings and approach to Christianity.

You argue that Charlie Kirk was part of a "rebranding of Christianity to prepare people for the Antichrist" and that he "preached politics, not Jesus." You believe he used Jesus' name for political agendas rather than preaching the true gospel. You specifically critique his movement as being his own agenda rather than following Christ's commission to preach the gospel.

In your notes, you mention that Charlie Kirk taught things that were "close but completely different" from what God tells Christians to do. You reference that he would say things like "you have to believe and focus on the divine" or "you need to make Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior" - which you consider false gospels that don't align with what you believe is the true gospel: that Jesus Christ died on the cross for the forgiveness of sins, was buried for three days, and rose from the grave.

You also discuss how people were emotionally responding to Charlie Kirk's assassination without "testing every spirit to see if it has come from God" as you believe Christians should do. You express that while you hate what happened to him and never delighted in his murder, you believe Christians shouldn't let emotions dictate their response but should discern whether his spirit and movement came from God - which you conclude it did not.

You compare Charlie Kirk's approach to that of the Pharisees and Sadducees who had "the appearance of godliness but denied the power of God" and plotted with political powers. You see his focus on political ideologies as serving two masters, which you believe Jesus warned against.

## Colophon[#](https://stephango.com/about#colophon)

This site is written and edited in [Obsidian](https://stephango.com/obsidian). I adhere to the philosophy of [File over app](https://stephango.com/file-over-app). My plain text Obsidian files are automatically compiled into web pages using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

The color palette is [Flexoki](https://stephango.com/flexoki), which I created for this site. My Jekyll template is not public, but you can get similar results from [this template](https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template) by Maxime Vaillancourt.
