## Show Notes 

This journal entry presents a critical analysis of Charlie Kirk's role in what the author views as a dangerous rebranding of Christianity. The author argues that Kirk, like other figures in the apologetic arena, used Jesus' name to advance political agendas rather than preaching the gospel, comparing this approach to the Pharisees and Sadducees who rejected Jesus while maintaining an appearance of godliness.

The entry draws parallels between Kirk's political focus and the historical partnership between religious leaders and government authorities who plotted against Jesus. The author contends that Kirk's emphasis on worldly events contradicts Jesus' teaching to focus on heavenly things and represents works of the flesh including strife, debate, and dissension.

The author expresses concern about the "great deception" and coming of the Antichrist, criticizing the false teaching of dominionism - the belief that Christians must establish God's kingdom on earth before Jesus' return. They argue that Jesus explicitly stated His kingdom is not of this world and doesn't require human effort to establish.

The entry condemns various religious institutions, identifying the Catholic Church as part of the "harlot church" and suggesting that Judaism, Christianity, and Islam form an unholy trinity of world religions. The author rejects theological concepts like the Trinity, Unitarianism, and Modalism as man-made philosophies rather than divine truth.

The journal concludes by criticizing Kirk for coming "in his own name" rather than in Jesus' name, comparing him to other historical figures who built movements around themselves. The author emphasizes that true Christian commission involves preaching the gospel, not starting political movements or revolutions, and warns against accepting leaders who promote their own agendas rather than Christ's message.

## Transcript

Charlie Kirk is a part of the rebranding of Christianity to prepare people for the Antichrist. You already have people in the apologetic arena that is on their own agenda, just like Charlie Kirk is or was. And who also used the same tactics as Charlie Kirk did. Charlie Kirk preached politics, not Jesus. He used Jesus' name for the political agenda in the political arena, which is no much more different. The government is not much different from the world religions. You remember when Jesus was in ministry on this earth in the New Testament, we see how the Jews and the Pharisees and the Sadducees that rejected Jesus had the appearance of godliness but denied the power of God. The whole time they plotted with the government with King Herod they pro- they plotted with politics to see Jesus murdered. I mean we see this before Jesus even entered into the scene, the nativity scene. They were trying to take him out before he came, tried to take him out while he was here but they couldn't take him out because he gave his life for his sheep and rose from the grave after the third day. Even Pontius Pilate was like this man is innocent and he washed his hands because he was like he knew he was about to hang an innocent man and what are the Jews who are again in partnership with the Roman Empire, the Roman government? Caesar is our king while boasting and proclaiming to be followers of God at the same time. And even Jesus called them hypocrites because they go far and wide seeking a convert to convert them to themselves and actually converts that person to hell right there with them. That is the apologetic arena. Same spirit. Same antichrist spirit that is so determined to convert people to Christianity. Come to Christianity. Come to Eastern Orthodox. Come to Protestantism. Come to whatever denomination that Jesus actually calls his followers to get out of. To get out of the harlot church. Just like the Jews that rejected Jesus the whole time. They're in front of people. They care about the praise of man. You see that if you go to Christ. You ask him to show you. If it is his will to show you, you'll see. That was the same agenda for Charlie Kirk, praise of man because you see that while he's no longer here what are people saying? His legacy building a statue of him, White House putting the flag at half mass for honoring Charlie. Good boy old Charlie. Charlie was the poster boy for Satan. I hate what happened to him that happened and I never delighted in how he was murdered or just in general this is still a soul, this is still a person but I will now sit here and allow my emotions to dictate what God tells us we're supposed to do which is to test every spirit to see if it's come from God. Charlie's did not come by God or from him. Jesus didn’t send Charlie to do to have people out here focused on worldly events when he says focus on heavenly things above. Meditate on the word of God day and night, not the word of man that are out here debating and arguing through politics, which he already warns about as a work of the flesh, strife, debate, dissensions, and rallying. All of that is what? These are evidence of the works of the flesh. These are some of the works of the flesh, but I'm just saying. And whereas I don't believe Charlie intentionally wanted to cause division, your good intentions mean nothing when your intentions are still rooted in your flesh and your intentions are not in Christ through the Spirit. You're going to fulfill the works of the flesh by default. If you do not believe that Jesus Christ died on the cross for the forgiveness of our sins, was buried in the tomb for three days, but after the third day he rose from the grave and is at the right hand of the Father in heaven. It is written to those of us in the body of Christ, so then walk in the cross...in the spirit so that you do not fulfill the lust of this world. You're going to fulfill the lust of this world when you are not focused on Jesus. You're not walking with him because you believed in him, but you believe in political ideologies instead. Jesus made it very clear you cannot serve two masters. God willing, I will continue talking about this because this is something that is heavily a part of the great deception and the coming of the Antichrist. He's going to sit himself up on the throne like he's God. Look at all these people I hear through the false teaching of dominionism, believing that they have to set up the kingdom for Jesus' return. No, Jesus never said to do that and he never will. Jesus says my kingdom is not of this world. He doesn't rely on the works and the efforts of man and flesh to set up his kingdom. When all he got to do is speak in his kingdom, come. And that's the thing. Because in the body of believers, when we're out here preaching the gospel, that's God's message. That's his power. That's his speech. That him speaking Jesus is the starter and the finisher of our faith. To those who believe and receive this gospel that was preached again that Jesus Christ died on the cross for our sins, was buried in the tomb for three days but after the third day he rose from the grave and is at the right hand of the Father in heaven. Those who believe in this gospel receive the Spirit of God who was preaching it. And notice that it has nothing to do with you leaning on Jesus, you say a sinner's prayer, you make him, make Jesus your Lord and Savior. What is all these other false gospels that have nothing to do with what I just said? What God says you'll never find none of those things that I just named and many more that people come up with. Oh, yeah, or another false gospel. There is no salvation outside of the Catholic Church. This is where people say made the church Jesus. Salvation is not in any institution nor is it even in the church because we're the ones that need to be saved. But that's a part of the harlot church though. The Catholic Church is not just the harlot and the whore of Babylon. It is all it that I believe the three heads is Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, the Abrahamic religions. That the Trinity of the world. And the Trinity of the world teaches the Trinity which is also false teaching. Unitarianism also false teaching. Modalism also false teaching. If you don’t know what I talking about don’t worry it ain’t got nothing to do with God. Any ism or schisms that come from the world ain't got nothing to do with God because the mysteries of God is where when you receive his spirit after you believed in Jesus he explains and showcases to you what the Godhead means which is what is written in the scriptures, not man's philosophy which God says is foolishness to him. Not man's philosophy that's out here debating through a script to try to prove God that showcases that they don't believe God exists. ,  of a stranger. Charlie Kirk came in his own name. His legacy is in his own name. It's his own movement. He said it was a movement that he started at 18. He started. No, that ain't Jesus. Jesus commissioned us to go out here and preach the gospel. Not start any other movement or revolution or whatever. That happens when the flesh gets in the way. From Kyan West to Martin Luther King to Elijah Muhammad to Malcolm X to all of these individuals, all these male figures and presidents, they're on their own movement, on their own agenda. And what does Jesus say to the Jews that rejected him? I come in the name of my Father, but you do not accept me. But if another man comes in his own name, you'll accept him. Charlie Kirk came in his own name. That's why his legacy has his name right there on it. , . And God bless.
