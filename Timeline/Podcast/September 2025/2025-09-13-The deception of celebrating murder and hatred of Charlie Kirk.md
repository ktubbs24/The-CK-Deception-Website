# The deception of celebrating murder and hatred of Charlie Kirk 

Date: 2025-09-13

## Show Notes 

The speaker expresses deep spiritual unrest following the assassination of Charlie Kirk, noting they deliberately avoided watching the video footage. They observe disturbing reactions on social media, where some people celebrate the murder while making hateful comments about Kirk's family and supporters.

While acknowledging disagreement with many of Kirk's teachings, particularly Christian nationalism and the "American way," the speaker emphasizes that celebrating murder is never acceptable. They reference Jesus's teaching that hatred in one's heart equals murder, explaining why many people delight in Kirk's death. The speaker criticizes selective judgment, where people condemn those they disagree with while celebrating murderers in their own communities.

The speaker strongly rejects the concept of Christian nationalism, arguing that Jesus explicitly stated His kingdom is not of this world. They believe efforts to create a Christian nation actually prepare the way for the Antichrist. True Christians should focus on Jesus Christ as the way, truth, and life, not political ideologies.

Reflecting on Kirk's teachings, the speaker notes how his focus remained on worldly matters rather than directing attention to Jesus. They criticize political engagement generally, explaining their decision to stop voting after becoming saved, believing God ordains all political leaders according to His sovereignty.

The speaker argues that America was never great because human efforts without Christ cannot succeed. They reference the biblical curse on human labor following Adam and Eve's sin, emphasizing that flesh cannot accomplish anything without the Spirit. They view America as potentially the perfect location for Satan's kingdom due to its false reputation as a Christian nation, its worship of materialism (mammon), and its promotion of the "American dream" over seeking God's kingdom.

The speaker concludes by condemning those who celebrate murder while claiming to value life, pointing out the hypocrisy of people who say "lives matter" but only care about their own lives, not others.

## Transcript

There is a lot going on right now, especially with the situation with the assassination of Charlie Kirk. My spirit has not rested well since I saw it happen. Thankfully, I didn't see the video. I didn't want to. There was opportunities to see it. I don't delight in watching someone getting murdered.  
  
I also understand with social media, a lot of people saw it and didn't want to see it either. But then you also have people who are on social media and they are delighting in seeing a man dying or bleeding to death and then will say the most heinous and evil things about his wife or his children or other people that he agreed with, that Charlie Kirk agreed with.  
  
There is a lot that Charlie has spoken about that is actually in opposition to the scriptures. We don't believe in this body of Christ. We don't believe in Christian nationalism. We don't believe in the American way. We believe in Jesus Christ, who is the way, the truth, and the life. What I will say is this. There are people that are celebrating murder  
  
But it's not a surprise because when you hate your neighbor, as Jesus says, when you hate someone, you've already murdered them in your heart. That's why we see so many people right now delighting in celebrating in or feeling very cold towards the death of Charlie Kirk.  
  
and will have selective hearing and selective bias as well as selective judgment when they will say things like, well, I feel like this about this man because he spoke out against me and made me feel bad or his opinions I didn't agree with, but then will celebrate a murderer in their own community or someone who also would be doing a lot of devastating things to people that they would consider are their own quote unquote kind. And  
  
Again, it's not a surprise, but it's still disgusting to say the least, especially when you have people out here professing to be Christian. I see once people started doing that or saying that, that's where I'm stepping in. I'm like, I don't know who you are, but you definitely ain't my brother or sister in Christ at all. Jesus says that people will know that you are my disciples and that you love one another. Love is not...  
  
favoritism either you don't get to pick and choose who you decide to love because that's not love that's called lust and people that walk according to the ways of this world or the American way or the way of whatever community that they come from that they have not been called out of or saved from by believing in Jesus well they're going to have a hate-filled heart they're going to practice prejudice  
  
But that practice is a practice of lawlessness, not a practice of righteousness, which is, again, what we do in the body of Christ when we have believed that Jesus Christ died on the cross for the forgiveness of our sins, was buried in the tomb for three days, but after the third day he rose from the grave and is at the right hand of the Father in heaven.  
  
Jesus said my kingdom is not of this world so for the folks out there who are under the delusion and the deception that Jesus wants to have a Christian nation or a kingdom that's of this world when he tells you his kingdom is not of this world and how he does not dwell in temples made by man's hands and yet you'll have man out here thinking they can make a temple for God and prepare a nation for God you don't realize  
  
because that's what deception is. You don't realize you're setting up the kingdom for the Antichrist to come, the false Christ. But regardless, whether a person is deceived or not, you don't celebrate murder. But only those who do that will. They do that on a daily basis when they show preferential treatment towards those who love or lust  
  
after the lust of their own flesh. Think about it. You got the same folks who will say, I'm not going to like anything you got to say unless you look like me, have the same skin color as me, yada, yada, all these excuses. They'll hate their own family members when their own family members speak out against them and expose their lies and hypocrisy.  
  
Why? That's what happens when you do preach the truth. Jesus Christ said, I did not come to bring peace but a sword, which actually is himself because he is the sword of truth since Jesus is the truth. So when you love the truth and you're in a family that don't, there's going to be division because how can two walk together unless there be agreement? There's a disagreement, there's discord, there's division when people love the truth.  
  
And when you got people that love lies, or in other words, when people love Jesus, or when you have people that love the lies of the devil, who is the father of lies, it ain't really got nothing to do with your skin color. The devil just paints his lies with different colors that people call black, white, yellow, whatever, so that people's attention will be on the flesh instead of on the actual matters that are destroying man, which is his lies and the practice of his lies, which will be sin.  
  
The ridiculous things that I've seen and the most disgusting things that I've seen online. I had went to sleep today. It's just like two days after the assassination, but still, I had went to sleep this morning. And I was up, still praying, studying, and observing some of the speeches that Charlie Kirk has said. Because I was familiar with him for a while. Long before, you know, his passing. But I didn't really care to keep up with him. Just like I didn't care to keep up with Ben Shapiro and  
  
Candace Owens or any kind of political debaters because a lot of the information they'll speak will be good on the surface but there's no substance the truth comes from Jesus the attention and the wisdom will be directed to Jesus when you're speaking on Jesus behalf not just claiming to be coming in his name but then talking about your own agenda that will be the agenda of the world so I didn't really keep up with any of them but I was familiar with who he was but  
  
These last couple of days, I was just like, this isn't what he taught, what he debated about, what he fought for. The attention is on him, not Jesus. I see why, Lord, you have me looking into this. Even trying to go to sleep, I rested maybe for like three or four hours and then I just woke up, went right back online and I'm seeing the same stuff  
  
that's troubling me. People over here are talking about watching his assassination like it's a movie, eating popcorn. Whether they did it or not, it's still a disgusting thing to say. God is exposing all of the murderers who I guarantee you will call themselves good people too, by the way. And I don't care what political affiliation they will associate themselves with.  
  
Because there's murderers on both sides. But that's because there's hatred for their fellow man on both sides, which means what Jesus says that you're supposed to do cannot be fulfilled. The second commandment, to love your neighbor as yourself, cannot be fulfilled. The second commandment, which is like the first, to love the Lord your God with all of your heart, soul, mind, and strength, cannot be fulfilled.  
  
when you love whatever political ideology and that's your God or your president, whoever you elect or whoever person is ruling over you or quote unquote representing you, that's your God. That's your king. Jesus ain't your king. I don't care if you say Jesus is king. Nope. That president is your king. Because the one who represents me is Jesus Christ. And I'm a witness of him on this earth.  
  
Ain't no man, no flesh represent me. When you know better, you do better. Before I was saved, I voted. After I was saved, I never voted again and never will. God willing, never will. Why would I participate in a system that is designed by the will of man, influenced by the God of this world, who tempts the will of man?  
  
Because everybody that's ordained in any type of political office is not ordained because of our voice. It's ordained because God's voice puts them in those positions. Even people that are in opposition to him because it's his will be done, his sovereignty fulfilled. Not our will be done. Not what we want. Not what we demand. Not what we vote.  
  
But before I go on a tangent, because I've already talked about this, there's a lot of murderers walking around. A lot of them losing their jobs, as they should be. But it's no surprise. I had said in a podcast a long time ago, I said, which I think I might even live in a lifetime where this would happen.  
  
that we live in society that sits here and says make America great again or let's go back to how things once were the past and I'm just sitting here like America was never great and no I'm not talking about when people speak on that term saying America was never great because of racial division or Jim Crow and all that other crap no America was never great because any effort  
  
that comes from the hands of man is not great God has said to Adam and Eve when they had sinned against him in the garden he said to Eve that you your desire will be for your husband but you will not be basically won't be fulfilled like your desire will be the leader the you know the one that will want to  
  
run the house or run the marriage or to rule as man was designated to rule or rather protect but no you won't be successful it's not going to happen notice we see this still fight happening today with the battle of the sexes and feminism and the idea of people wanting to have a matriarchy patriarchy ain't good either but i'm just saying but then  
  
she also Eve was to suffer pain through child labor and giving birth her form of labor that's her pain that she's going to be experiencing through that form of labor the form of labor that man or Adam will be experiencing was when God said cursed is the ground because of you when he was speaking to Adam  
  
for you will work the ground all the days of your life and from the sweat of your brow that he was going to work the ground the same ground that is cursed and dust you came from it a dust you shall return and this is showcasing how the efforts of man the work of man the work of the flesh that comes from the dust of the ground  
  
will not be successful. You cannot be successful or quote unquote great without Christ. You can't be successful without God. He is success. He is the truth. He is solution because he's the truth. Even Jesus said the spirit gives life, the flesh can do nothing. The same flesh that is out there mindlessly and vainlessly through hustle culture or through legacy trying to build and what has God let happen to empires that are in rebellion to him? They fall.  
  
So no, America was never great. Just like any other empire in this world, this fallen world was never great. And so when Charlie is preaching about that and many other people are preaching about that, they're actually preaching against what Jesus says and warns about and even tells us basically to turn our back on the world because we turned our back to God when we didn't know him, when we didn't believe in Jesus.  
  
Our back is to God when we're living in rebellion to him. When your back is to the world, you're not trying to make a fort within it. You're not trying to better it because you know it cannot get better. It's going to get worse. Because it's the same world that is in opposition to God, the same world that hates him. You ain't going to build a Christian nation. What you're going to end up doing is building an anti-Christian nation that's already a nation that's already anti-Christian.  
  
And Satan wouldn't have, I wouldn't even think, and I'm not trying to give this evil being props, but just taking a look at his tactics, America would be the perfect place for him to build his kingdom or to put his throne here in America. Because A, America or the president is considered the leader of the free world. And I'm just sitting here like that's just a term because the world is definitely not free.  
  
,   
  
You got a country that many people believe is still a Christian nation. Even professing Christians believe it's a Christian nation. It's not a Christian nation. It never was a Christian nation. No, it was not. A Christian nation has to have Christ at the head of that nation, the king of that nation, not a man. See what I'm saying? And if it was a man, it'd still be Jesus leading that person because  
  
that man will be a man of God and the principles and the fruits of the spirit that that man would display would be representation of Jesus in that man. But I have yet to see any president that showcases that. I have yet to see any president that showcases that. At least in my lifetime. I'm born in 1990. Most presidents are  
  
based in good intentions, not good fruit of God. Very, very drastic difference. America, land of the free, home of the brave, or American pride. Oh, yeah. This would be the perfect place for Satan to set up his throne. The whole entire world thinks this is a Christian nation. And it's the devil that deceives the whole world. Capitalistic society where people worship mammon  
  
Jesus makes it very clear. You cannot serve God in mammon. You'll love one or hate the other. You can't serve two masters. So many people serve the American dream and the American way of life, which Charlie preached. That's mammon. Part of that is mammon. The opposition to Jesus. You see, on the money in God we trust. You got to be in God first to trust. And to walk in him.  
  
Faith is at the beginning of your walk with Christ, to believe in Jesus Christ. And then you trust him for all things. You submit yourself to him in every area of your life, not just on one day of the week. And American patriotism or any type of patriotism of any country, it doesn't matter, is heavily religious. It's basically worship.  
  
country or worship idolizing creation over the creator to the point where you got people saying that the creator represents their country. You even hear it in the speech where may God bless America. Why should he? I'm 34 years old. Why should he bless America when you see America is so full of lies and how it treats its own people but comes off as righteous and  
  
Oh no, America is in for some judgment. Some righteous judgment. Especially when America's out here claiming to be the beacon of hope. Wait, no, no, no. I thought Jesus was the beacon of hope. Do y'all see it? You see what I'm saying? The land of opportunity. What? Jesus says, seek first the kingdom of God and all of his righteousness and everything you need will be given unto you. By also saying, he also said that the kingdom of heaven...  
  
is in the midst of you. The kingdom of God is in the midst of you. He was talking about himself when he was saying that. My kingdom is not of this world, while also saying, I come from above. He says, peace I leave with you, peace I give to you, not as the world gives. The world will give you a false peace, which is how the Antichrist deceives people, the Antichrist spirit.  
  
The same Antichrist spirit telling everybody else, this is the land of opportunity and freedom. Telling the world to seek American soul for freedom, not Jesus, but soul, government, political policies and amendments instead of Jesus.  
  
come here and work hard to make a living in America where Jesus says come to me all of you who are a heavy burden take upon my yoke and my burden is light I will give you rest for your souls nope Americans like hustle culture stay up you don't need to rest until you're dead but the whole lie is that you're already dead in your sins when you don't believe in Jesus  
  
But you're lied to in America, told that you're not dead, that you're alive and you're free. So this is why I said that it's a very dangerous thing that Charlie Kirk was teaching. But regardless, how we communicate about his death is not pleasing to God when it is delighting in death.  
  
especially when his death was, according to the news sources, and I speak like this because in the age of information, a lot of stuff is not what it seems, but I'm just going to say it like that. According to the news sources and the videos, this man was assassinated. We don't talk about murder as if it's a good thing, but only those who are, they have no problem with hate and murder.  
  
they do that on a regular basis watch out because some of the main ones who are the murderers are the ones who also pretend that life matters and will say white lives matter or black lives matter some of them will be lying to you about that that they care about life but they only care about their own life not nobody else's see the hypocrisy anyway I love you all thank you so much for listening  
  
and God bless.
