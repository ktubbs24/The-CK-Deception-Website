# Testing the spirit behind Charlie Kirk's message
---
Date:  2025-09-21

## Show Notes 

The speaker argues that people are too distracted by analyzing Charlie Kirk's assassination and related conspiracies instead of focusing on what Christians should be doing according to God's teachings. They emphasize that Christians should "test every spirit to see if it has come from God," which they claim Charlie Kirk did not properly teach.

The speaker expresses uncertainty about Kirk's salvation, stating that while they believe he is in heaven with Jesus, this would only be true if Kirk believed in the "true gospel of Christ" before his death. They define the true gospel as Jesus Christ dying on the cross for forgiveness of sins, being buried for three days, then rising and sitting at the right hand of the Father in heaven.

The speaker criticizes Kirk and many evangelicals for preaching "multiple different gospels that do not save," citing examples of what they consider incorrect teachings from Kirk's videos, such as focusing on "the divine" or making Jesus "Lord and Savior" without proper context. They argue that Kirk was pursuing his own agenda rather than following Christ's true calling.

The speaker concludes by asserting that people are failing to test whether Kirk's spirit or the spirit behind his movement came from God, declaring definitively that it does not come from God at all.

## Transcript 

There are many people that are too focused on trying to analyze Charlie Kirk's assassination and focusing on so many different conspiracies, which is actually all still a distraction as well. Because the real thing that we're supposed to be doing as Christians in the body of Christ is what God tells us to do. Which ironically, that's not what Charlie taught. He taught something close but completely different. God tells us to test every spirit to see if it has come from God. And you have too many people in their emotions not doing that. And they're speaking ahead in terms saying that Charlie Kirk is in heaven. I know that he is. I believe that he is. He's right there with Jesus and unless Charlie believed in the true gospel of Christ before he had his last debate or public conversation, no, before he was shot, no he would not be or he would not be going.  
  
The true gospel is that Jesus Christ died on the cross for the forgiveness of our sins, was buried in the tomb for three days, but after the third day he rose from the grave and is at the right hand of the Father in heaven. Charlie, like many, I can't even say the term, Charlie, like many evangelicals, like many people who are in the idolatry, the many Christian or anti-Christian denominations preach multiple different gospels that does not save. Some of which that I've heard after coming across his videos where he was like, you know, you have to believe and focus on the divine. What? What? Or you'll need to make Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior. What? You need to seek out what you believe and then follow that to be successful. What? Just go and look at the videos. Discern what he says with what Christ will call us to say and call us to do out here.  
  
You'll see that he was on his own agenda. But many people are not doing that. They're not testing to see if the spirit of Charlie or even the spirit behind his movement came from God. I'm here to tell you, no, it does not. It does not come from God at all. Thank you.
