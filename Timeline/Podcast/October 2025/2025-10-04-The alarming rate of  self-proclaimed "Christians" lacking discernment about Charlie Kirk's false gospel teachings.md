# 2025-10-04-The alarming rate of  self-proclaimed "Christians" lacking discernment about Charlie Kirk's false gospel teachings
---
Date: 2025-10-04 

## Show Notes 

The speaker expresses deep concern about Christians lacking discernment regarding Charlie Kirk, who was recently assassinated. They argue that many believers are defending Kirk without properly testing his teachings against scripture, as commanded in the Bible.

The speaker clarifies they are not mocking Kirk's assassination, which they acknowledge as tragic, but rather warning against elevating him as a prophet-like figure. They note that Kirk preached false gospels, focusing on works-based salvation ("lean on Jesus" or "give your life to Christ") rather than the true gospel of believing in Christ's death and resurrection.

The analysis extends to Kirk's mentor Frank Turek and others who preach incomplete gospels, often omitting Christ's resurrection - what the speaker calls "half the gospel" that Satan promotes. They emphasize that the complete gospel, as outlined in 1 Corinthians 15, includes Christ's death for sins, burial, and resurrection on the third day.

The speaker observes alarming parallels between current reactions to Kirk and biblical warnings about the Antichrist. They note people saying "I am Charlie Kirk" and treating him as a messianic figure, which they see as preparation for accepting the future Antichrist as savior instead of Jesus.

Drawing on programming metaphors, the speaker describes how Satan manipulates people through worldly "scripts" and programs, while true believers operate according to God's program. They emphasize that Jesus gives discernment to see these spiritual "bugs" in false teachings.

The speaker admits feeling grief and struggling with motivation while witnessing this deception, though they maintain their joy comes from the Lord. They plan to create an archive channel exposing Kirk's false teachings to help others practice biblical discernment.

The entry concludes with the complete reading of 1 Corinthians 15, emphasizing the importance of Christ's resurrection as essential to the gospel message.

## Transcript

I believe that there are way too many, way too many people that have settled for the idea that just because somebody is bold or charismatic or seems seemingly confident or seemingly intelligent or more intelligent than themselves that they must be preaching for God, that they must be  
  
Demonstrating the wisdom that God gives to those who believe in his son, Jesus Christ. I am seeing an alarming amount of people online that profess to be Christian that are lacking discernment or lacking showcasing discernment about the situation pertaining to Carly Church. Excuse me, Charlie Kirk. See, I can't even talk right now.  
  
because I was watching videos or thumbnails and so many people are defending him understandably so if they're talking about you don't mock or laugh when somebody has been assassinated because that's clearly that you just don't do that but so many people are defending this man and I don't even think most of them at all  
  
are obeying what Christ tells us to do, to test every spirit to see if it has come from God. I am not brand new to who Charlie Kirk was before he was assassinated. I was aware of him over the years on and off. I didn't really care to watch many political debates because most of it is just hogwash, to be honest. Yes, good facts are spoken. Yes, information is given that people should be applying. But I mean, the truth of Jesus Christ is  
  
the gospel is not really preached in political circles because the politics and policies is people's idols the gospel is that you must believe that Jesus Christ died on the cross for the forgiveness of our sins was buried in the tomb for three days but after the third day he rose from the grave and is at the right hand of the father in heaven and Charlie the many videos I've come across he didn't preach this he preaches  
  
So many of these false gospels that are out here where I've heard people say you must lean on Jesus or you must give your life to Christ. That's not the gospel. That's not the gospel. You doing something versus Jesus says you must believe is two completely different things. And not only that,  
  
Charlie preached a lot of false teaching. Going through his videos, I'm at the point where I had to pray and I'm like, Lord, I think I'm going to have to make an archive channel because the amount of stuff that he has said. And there are some people out there that are exposing Charlie's speeches and stuff. People that he disagreed with or that disagreed with him. People that are not coming from the angle that I will be coming from, where there's more of the world's perspective.  
  
But there are a few, very, very, very few, and it's understandably so because few find the straight and narrow path. Few ministry channels, probably like two or three, that I have come across that are also doing what I'm doing, warning the brethren, warning the body of Christ, how this person, Charlie, like many people, are being boasted up as like a prophet.  
  
People acting like he is the Messiah. The world acts like he is the Messiah. Came to save America. And then people out here don't realize they're blaspheming, sitting here saying that this is what God wanted for us. As if that was a good thing. Now, I know that God gives us over to our heart's desire. So anybody that's in a position of influence, authority, ordination,  
  
He ordained anybody that gets that much, anybody that will get the amount of influence to be heard by so many ears. That ain't got nothing to do with what you did, your efforts.  
  
How hard you work. These are things that Charlie talked about. How hard you have to work and sacrifice sleep and all this other kind of stuff. He talks like the world because he was still of it. And it don't matter. Because when it's time, when you're in Christ, when it's time for him, for Jesus to elevate you, it's not really you that is being elevated. It's he is allowing for his word to be preached.  
  
in you you will be presented before people or stand before kings as it is written when is your time it ain't got nothing to do with you but Satan also offers a faulty deal similar to that but it's still a lie we see in the temptation in the wilderness where the third temptation that the devil approached Jesus with was look before you all of the kingdoms of this earth that you see before you  
  
They have been given to me and I can give them to you if you just bow down and worship me. And so many people agree. Many people obey that offering. And that's how they'll get to these high positions. And it's even warned that we don't wrestle against flesh and blood, but against evil principalities and wickedness in high places. In these high positions, in these offices, in these authoritative places.  
  
influential positions. That's why Jesus said, What profit a man to gain the whole world but lose his soul? So just because a person may have a large subscribe count or following count or a lot of influence, so many people just by default, man, that had to be the move of God. Well, yeah, in a way, yeah, because ain't nothing happening under God's watch, metaphorically speaking, of course, but nothing that's going to be happening under the sun that God is not instructing.  
  
He's the one that says man may make his plans, but the Lord orders his steps. He is the one who says to those in the body of Christ that he makes you a fishers of men. He draws his sheep to himself. Those who are not his sheep are not going to hear his voice. They're not going to follow or obey him. So they're going to have for themselves teachers, ministers of the devil, who masquerade as an angel, like an angel of righteousness, too, like an angel of light, like their father, the devil. And they're going to have large crowds.  
  
And actually, the largest crowds, not all the time, but the largest crowds is just symbolic of what Jesus said, how broad and wide is the way that leads to destruction. And many go in it, but narrow and straight is the way that leads to eternal life and few find it. That's why I'm not surprised there's few ministries that I've come across. And I'm not looking, but you know how YouTube and social media is. You watch one video, they want to see you all, a hundred of them, like here.  
  
Let me feed your flesh. No, I don't want to. But while I am actually in the process of making another YouTube channel specifically exposing the deception of the Charlie Kirk deception, this whole ordeal, this whole Trojan horse to the body of Christ. I do want to make and have been making videos where all I do, I just pull the video.  
  
and then do commentary because the thing is is that so many people will understandably so say this has been taken out of context you've cut him off or you cut this person off you cut her off and I'm not saying this has been said to me because I'm just not really starting doing commentary videos but I have seen this said a lot on other channels over the years when I've observed and studied um  
  
Yes, this actually is a true thing that happens where people will take something out of context and cut something off. But there are certain things when they're said, whether they're in context or not, that the context doesn't change. There are certain things that it's just like, no, this would not, even if you had a full sentence, this would not be the arrangement of words of something that can be said without you raising a red flag or like, what?  
  
So to avoid all of that, and especially because I don't want nobody sitting here just trusting me because I'm saying something. The point of this archive video channel and website is for people to practice discernment. A part of discipling others. And I'm not going to be able to teach you how to catch anything. The Holy Spirit will give you ears to hear and eyes to see to do that. But  
  
I will at least with these videos showcase how the slip of the tongue is or how a person can just say something at one part of a video and it sounds so encouraging that you'll get lost in that and then within two minutes later how they'll be saying the complete opposite of what they originally said this happens so much when a person is just spitting  
  
whatever they have learned from the world because the world is inconsistent lines come from this world and I'm not even about I'm not the type of person to sit here and say well this person meant this and their heart was here no because I don't know what a person's intentions are a lot of times we do a lot of things lacking self-awareness or lacking awareness lacking understanding which comes when we lack Christ  
  
Not us speaking, not me speaking to you, but I'm speaking in general. When a person does not have the fear of the Lord, they're not going to have awareness. They're going to be blind still, spiritually. And yes, you can make some mistakes here and there in your speech, in the body of Christ. But again, this is why on this archive channel, I'll have so many of his videos, speeches and stuff, especially since his wife,  
  
Erica Kirk is claiming to release hundreds of other videos that are in the archive that were not released yet. Because this is all a part. What's spiritually happening right now is brainwashing. Because people are already desensitized. So many people are already desensitized to the truth.  
  
because they're still being entertained still being washed in still being submerged not in Christ not in the living water which is Jesus Christ but in the world they're still in like a dark abyss and all they have to do all the God of this world, the devil has to do is to just keep repeating the same thing over and over and over and over again and they're already vulnerable people are already really vulnerable people are already very emotional  
  
,   
  
I didn't really watch his videos that much until after the assassination. I was aware of him long before that. Him, Candace Owens, Ben Shapiro, with the other guy's name, who also used to sit at the table on college campuses that would be like, change my mind type thing. Which again, that's already, again, that's worldly. That was something that Charlie used to preach. You know, prove me wrong, change my mind. No. No.  
  
when you believe in Jesus you don't talk like that because you know your mind was changed by him by Jesus and no human being can change your mind you only that alone is a myth because think about it nobody gonna force you to eat something you already don't want to eat if it's something that you already are interested in considering or wanting  
  
Nobody got to make you do it. Nobody got to change your mind about the diet that you want to eat. Life and death are in the power of the tongue. Those who love it will eat its choice fruit. God planted two trees that he specifically focused on in Genesis 2. Two trees in the garden. The tree of life was also in the middle of the garden. And the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Both were pleasurable to the sight and good for food. You ain't got to sit here and change nobody's mind about anything.  
  
they're going to eat. They're going to gather for themselves whatever teachers are going to feed them. They're going to eat what they want to eat. And Jesus even said about his sheep, my sheep don't listen to the voice of a stranger. Why? Because his sheep only love the truth. His sheep only going to eat from the hand of God, which is Jesus. They're not eating from the hand of the devil. We ain't eating from the hand of the devil out here. So when I would see some of these videos, I would get like, I don't know,  
  
My stomach, I just would, I don't even know how to describe how I'm feeling. I think this is the first time I've actually felt like this in my ministry with exposing evil works. This is another level. I don't know if it's grief. I don't know. I don't know. It's just, it's pains. I wouldn't be surprised.  
  
birth pains this is the beginning of all of this but there's more to come it's just it's too many people it's too many people that are lost it's too many people they're looking for a man to be their savior  
  
And there's too many people who are. It just keeps revealing how many, so many people who are just going to be ready. Their heart's going to be ready and ripe and receptive for the Antichrist when he comes. And that's what they're going to look for is their Savior, not Jesus.  
  
That's who they're going to call their Savior. The one who makes himself up a throne like the Most High God and calling himself God. Calling himself Jesus. Well, the people are going to be calling the Antichrist Jesus too. They're already doing it. They're already doing it. When they're out here and the ministers of Satan are out here doing the work of the devil and they're calling them Christians. They're calling them  
  
followers of God. They're calling their wit and so-called illusion of discipline a form of wisdom of God and the power of the Holy Spirit. They're out here calling what is bad good. And for those of us out here warning, they're calling good evil. You must be racist. You must be jealous. You must be that. I'm just sitting here like I don't care about any of this. I don't care about  
  
any of those things I'm only listening to what this man said I don't care what color his skin was I don't care if he was a female or a male well no hold on let me rephrase that I don't care if the person that Charlie Kirk represented or the character he played and the actor that he played rather I don't care if the actor was a male or a female it don't matter to me if you speak a lie  
  
,   
  
A lot of those people are talking like that, but they're not even trying to listen. They're not trying to be quick to listen and slow to speak. That's how the devil will use people to falsely accuse brethren. And the devil is the accuser of brethren. I mean, this is just, it's so much going on right now. I'm going to be honest with y'all. I have my routine that I try to be consistent with.  
  
  
  
For days, I've been fighting getting out of the bed. No, I'm not depressed at all either because I still do the things I need to do. I still have joy when I do everything because my joy comes from the Lord. The joy of the Lord is my strength, not my motivation, not my drive, not my ambition and desire for what I'm trying to get in this world because I don't care about this world. But I have been fighting so hard to get out of the bed.  
  
While I'm thinking about these things, I'm not anxious, though. Here's the thing. I'm not anxious. I'm not scared. I'm not frightful. I'm not concerned about myself or my life. I am not afraid of what I'm seeing happening, but I am grieved. I think I'm mourning right now and have been for days  
  
Because the amount of tenacity and zeal that I would find people have for this man. This reminds me of what Jesus said. How he said to those who didn't believe in him, the Jews that didn't believe in him, I come in the name of my father, but you do not accept me.  
  
But if another man comes in his own name, you'll accept him. Charlie Kirk came in his own name. I mean, you see people today, see and hear people today talking about, we are Charlie Kirk. We are Charlie Kirk. I am Charlie Kirk. People crying and getting hysterical, which is ridiculous, over another human being that's like them. Another individual that is like them that...  
  
People crying. I'm not talking about the fact that he died. I'm talking about like, I've seen a few videos where people will put that their Charlie Kirk on their cup of Starbucks. They will want that to be written on their name. When people ask you, what is your name at Starbucks? And they're like, I'm Charlie Kirk. And there are some people that are not going to sit here and entertain that. Honestly, if I had worked at Starbucks, Lord, thank you for calling me out of not working.  
  
and doing my computer work in the Starbucks coffee shop anymore because I don't want to go on a tangent and talk about the symbology of the logo, especially as a graphic artist. But if I were in ignorance working in Starbucks, I wouldn't have written that down. I would have still grieved over the fact that the man was assassinated right there next to, I believe, I heard that people said that he was right next to his daughter or that his children and wife were able to see. I don't know.  
  
But even if not, it's still horrible. It's human life. It's an individual's life. But I'm not going to sit here and entertain this foolery. What is your name? See, I don't have time for that. Because for one, if you lie to me and tell me I'm Charlie Kirk and somebody else is like, I'm Charlie Kirk, you're lying. You're not Charlie Kirk. And so now you're going to have me sit here and write down your name or get fired.  
  
Because you know how people say the customer is always right. Now I see this. I'm so glad God called me out of this world and the workforce of this world. I can't. My first job was Chick-fil-A and I would sit there and smile. A genuine smile. And my manager was like, you're not smiling hard enough. And I'm like, I'm not going to sit here and pretend and fake it. I'm not going to sit here and do that. That is weird. I am not going to do that.  
  
I want to be in the back. I love cooking. Let me go in the back. I don't care if it's hot. I am not going to sit here and deal with nobody's money. And I ain't going to sit here and pretend. How was your day? Hello? I don't talk like, don't give me a doggone script. That is so disingenuous. It is not genuine at all. Let me speak to the customer genuinely, which I have no problem with doing. Maybe a script is helpful for people who don't know how to do that, but they still need to know how to do that on their own.  
  
And that's how so many people operate in the world in general. They run in on a script that ain't of God. This is why people have these false gospels I hear talking about. You need to pray Jesus into your heart. So say this prayer. There goes a script. That's a lie. That's a lie. Right? That's a lie. That ain't the gospel. Or people be having scripts in the apologetic arena.  
  
when Jesus said through the Holy Spirit that he'll give you a word to speak they don't believe in him so they gotta have their own script set up so they'll not be proven wrong they gotta be right everybody this world is just it's a script I remember hearing a quote I think it was attributed to um wow how did his name drop out of my mind that fast but uh basically the quote I think I'm gonna just try to summarize it because I don't think I'm gonna say it word for word properly but the quote goes something like um  
  
The whole world's a stage and everyone's an actor or something like that. Yeah, it's a script. People are running on programs. I'm going to talk in this terminology because I've just started to learn how to code back in March. And I feel techie, very techie. Because I didn't think I could ever do this. But everybody's running on a program. And who's programming? We have TV program, internet programming, social media programming.  
  
,   
  
Kind of like if you were to type on the computer and you're going to press start on a game. And the program is basically like if user input is pressing the button or pressing enter, then present them with the message of, hello, begin the game. See, this is like a computer program, but I'm trying to tell y'all how that's relatable to how a lot of people are. They'll watch the news. That's the prompt.  
  
And that's the script. And then people are triggered by it, by their flesh. This is how Satan is the developer of the flesh. Not the developer. Hold on. Let me take that back. The developer of all things is Jesus Christ. The one who manipulates and puts a virus into the program will be Satan. He is a developer, but not the developer. The one that will sit here and be hacking everything.  
  
the system and so like you have people that will be following the script I feel anxious, why? because this happened, yep, this is the script if this happens then that happens if this happens that happens you feel this way and then when you try to tell people there is no fear in the Lord for his perfect love  
  
cast out all fear the person will sit here pretending to be Christian will sit here and say that's not true this is literally what is written in the scriptures y'all what are you talking about what are you talking about are you more focused about how you're defining things based off of how the program of the world taught you how to define things or are you going to define things how God defines things that's how you be holy as he is holy when you believe in him  
  
He shows you how things actually are. He shows you this is nothing to be afraid of and you believe it because you actually have the knowledge and understanding of why there's nothing to be afraid of about that particular thing. Or everything, really. And you'll see the hack. Just like how if I were, but when I was like about six, seven months ago, I had no idea how to be able to catch a bug in a program if I was looking at the code. I would know now, still learning, but now  
  
I'm able to look and be like, oh, this is missing a semicolon at the end of the statement. So then it's not going to run. Oh, this is not indented properly. That's a bug. Let's fix this. Oh, this is capitalized when this shouldn't be capitalized. You're able to see these bugs in the code or in the program, or as some people like to say, I don't really like to reference, but the matrix because Jesus gives you eyes to see. He's the developer. It's his story. It's his program.  
  
We run on his program. We don't sit here and be like, this is my schedule. This is my program. And God want God to associate with it. Or I'm going to put God in my plans. No, we run on his program. And then he tells you what's going to happen. This is prophecy. He already tells you how things are. He tells you how people are. He knows how his program works. But the thing is, is that he's not sitting here making people think a certain type of way or act a certain type of way. He's just revealing.  
  
why they choose the things that they choose. Why people may hate other people. Why people love what is evil. Why people love the truth. Love him. He lets you know all these things. This is when you don't take it personal because you're like, oh, this is just the, all this is, is just a bug in the code. This is another bug. And then people will be so more focused on the program isn't working. And it's like,  
  
Yeah, it's not working because this right here, if we just change it, don't tell me what to do. Okay, so I'm going to try this one more time because I know you're told two times. If not, dust your feet off. So if you just change this right here, you realize that it's not going to give you a syntax error. The code is going to run properly. People are going to function properly when they believe in Jesus. He's the main part of the program. And then you'll still have people. I do believe in him.  
  
You can't tell me... And I'm just sitting here like, all right. Got to get away from a divisive person. Dust your feet off. What is this showing me, Lord? Yep, they don't like instruction. All code is is instructions to the computer. They don't want instruction from you, Lord. They don't. They don't want instruction. Yeah, I remember you did say that, though. A fool despises wisdom and instruction. Mm-hmm.  
  
Your wisdom and instruction. And all I am just doing is directing you to, directing them to you. And they're getting frustrated because through pride, they're like, I already know him. I already know what I need to do. I already read this in the Bible. I already did it. They're only talking about, I'm aware of this knowledge. I'm aware of this knowledge. I'm aware of this knowledge, but they're not applying it.  
  
And that's how you know they wouldn't believe in Jesus. Because the application of the knowledge of God is only applied through wisdom and understanding. The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom and understanding. Knowledge and understanding. But the fool despises it. Because the fool just wants knowledge. They want to be like God, knowing good and evil. The lie of the devil. I know it already. I know, I know. And God is far from the proud.  
  
when you're walking with Christ you know you know nothing that's the that's I can actually say that's the only thing I know for certain everything else I don't know nothing I know I know nothing I know I know nothing ain't nothing you can know a lot about something but you don't know nothing to know something means you know everything about the thing you're claiming to know I just know a little information about this this this and that and that's all of us all of us are ignorant all of us are ignorant of something  
  
that's why it's ridiculous, it's ridicule, and it's actually condemning to call people stupid, fool, ignorant, as if you ain't, what do you know, do you know everything, no, so how can you sit here and call somebody else ignorant, you ignorant too, it's a dangerous thing, because in that person, all their head knowledge, I already know, I already know, I believe in God, I worship God,  
  
,   
  
And they're using his name for clout. Which is not surprising. Because, you know, you shouldn't be upset. Because if Jesus, as Paul said, even if Jesus is preached with ill motives, he's still being preached. That name is still being pronounced. Right? So somebody who's never heard of him. Somebody who, now they actually might go on the journey of what Jesus said to do. To seek first the kingdom of God and all of his righteousness.  
  
So that's good. The error where we come in in the body of Christ is leading them to Jesus Christ, not the Jesuses that the serpent then came up with. All the pseudonames or all the false characteristics of Jesus that has came from the devil. Because then when people are like, oh, Jesus is king on life.  
  
Now they're going, and many times, because they're still in the flesh, just because you say Jesus is the king, that doesn't save you. So then a lot of these people are still walking in the flesh thinking that just because I know Jesus is king now, I'm saved. Just because I know Jesus died on the cross, I'm saved. A lot of people are out here preaching half of the gospel. That's the gospel that the devil preaches. He preaches half the gospel.  
  
Don't think he don't. The devil is the father of lies. Half of the truth is still a lie. Half of the gospel, this is something that God had warned me about years ago to be watchful of people too. Half of the gospel is just focusing on Jesus' death. And then that's a period. There's no comma. There'll be just a period. And a lot of people will be just focusing on, this is what Jesus did for me on the cross.  
  
and to somebody who's never heard never heard the gospel they don't know what's in them scriptures all they actually heard was the knowledge of this is what Jesus did for me on the cross it's like what was specifically what did he do he redeemed us how how he overcame death how see this is like there's bits and pieces a lot of these songs  
  
that claim to be gospel music also do that. They're bits and pieces of the gospel. And I think typically what we end up doing when we are saved, we just end up filling that in naturally because we know him. But for people who are still lost and who haven't heard the gospel, they're not getting the full gospel. The gospel is that Jesus Christ died on the cross for our sins, for the forgiveness of our sins. He was buried in the tomb for three days, but after the third day he rose from the grave and he's at the right hand of the Father in heaven  
  
The devil doesn't want to preach the second half of the gospel because he doesn't want people to know that Jesus overcame death by rising from the grave. So half of the gospel that's actually being preached, which is still not the full gospel at all, is just he on the cross. He died on the cross. And that's so dangerous because then people become, in their mind, they think they've been saved by attaining knowledge of Calvary.  
  
but not the power of God of what Jesus did on Calvary. See, Satan is very sneaky. Again, these are things that Charlie preached. Many of these, it's not just Charlie. His mentor was another person that God warned me about, Frank Turek. Years ago, years ago, was this the other guy from the Living Waters ministry?  
  
They don't, again, I have not come across any video yet where they actually preach the full gospel. They have their own additions. They'll grab this piece from the scripture and this piece. First Corinthians literally gives the gospel. Let me go pull it up real quick. It's verbatim according to the scriptures. And you'll still have people that because they operate on their own script, their own agenda, their own program. They cannot follow God's program because they're on their own program.  
  
1 Corinthians 15 Now I will remind you, brothers, of the gospel I preached to you, which you received, in which you stand, and by which you are being saved, if you hold fast to the word I preached to you, unless you believe in vain. For I delivered to you, as of first importance,  
  
What I also received, that Christ died for our sins in according with the scriptures, that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the scriptures, and that he appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve. Then he appeared to more than 500 brothers at one time, most of whom are still alive, though some have fallen asleep. Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles. Last of all, as to one untimely born, he appeared also to me.  
  
So we preach, and so you believed.  
  
Now, if Christ is proclaimed as raised from the dead, how can some of you say that there is no resurrection of the dead? See, here's where he's talking about people who didn't believe in the gospel. But if there is no resurrection of the dead, then not even Christ has been raised. And if Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is in vain and your faith is in vain. We are even found to be misrepresenting God because we testified about God that he raised Christ, whom he did not raise if it is true that the dead are not raised. So again, he's  
  
this is him talking about people who did not believe in the resurrection you do still have people today who claim to believe in God don't believe in the resurrection if they don't believe in the resurrection they don't believe in Jesus Christ rising from the grave this is why I was saying the devil preaches many false gospels but one of them that many people need to be aware of is half of the gospel where he just focuses on Jesus being dead not raising from the grave let me continue um  
  
For if the dead are not raised, not even Christ has been raised. And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile and you are stealing your sins. Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished. If in Christ we have hope in this life only, we are of all people most to be pitied. But in fact, Christ has been raised from the dead, the first fruits of those who have fallen asleep. For as by a man came death, but a man has come also the resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die,  
  
So also in Christ shall all be made alive. But each in his own order, Christ the firstfruits, then at his coming those who will own to Christ. Then comes the end, when he delivers the kingdom to God, the Father, after destroying every rule and every authority and power. For he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet. The last enemy to be destroyed is death, for God has put all things in subjection under his feet. But when it says all things are put in subjection,  
  
It is plain that he is expected who put all things in subjection under him. When all things are subjected to him, then the Son himself will also be subjected to him who put all things in subjection under him. That God may be all in all. Otherwise, why do people mean by being baptized on behalf of the dead? If the dead are not raised at all, why are people baptized on their behalf? Why are we in danger every hour? I protest, brothers, by my pride in you, which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord. I die every day  
  
What do I gain if, humanly speaking, I fought with beasts at Ephesus? If the dead are not raised, let us eat and drink for tomorrow we die. Do not be deceived. Bad company ruins good morals. Wake up from your drunken stupor, as is right, and do not go on sinning. For some have no knowledge of God. I say this to your shame. I think I'll go ahead and finish reading the rest of it. But someone will ask, how are the dead raised?  
  
With what kind of body do they come, you foolish person? What you sow does not come to life unless it dies. And what you sow is not the body that is to be, but a bare kernel, perhaps of wheat or of some other grain. But God gives it a body as he has chosen, and to each kind of seed its own body. For not all flesh is the same, but there is one kind for humans, another for animals, another for birds, and another for fish.  
  
there are heavenly bodies and earthly bodies but the glory of the heavenly is of the one kind and the glory of the earthly is of another there is one glory of the sun and another glory of the moon and another glory of the stars for star differs from star and glory so is it with the resurrection of the dead what is sown is perishable what is raised is imperishable it is sown in dishonor it is raised in glory it is sown in weakness  
  
It is raised in power. It is sown a natural body. It is raised a spiritual body. If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual body. Thus it is written, the first man, Adam, became a living being. The last Adam became a living, a life-giving spirit. But it is not the spiritual that is first, but the natural and then the spiritual. The first man was from the earth, a man of dust. The second man is from heaven.  
  
As was the man of dust, so also are those who are of the dust. And as is the man of heaven, so also are those who are of heaven. Just as we have borne the image of the man of dust, we shall also bear the image of the man of heaven. I tell you this, brothers, flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable. Behold, I tell you a mystery. We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed in a moment.  
  
In the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet, for the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised imperishable, and we shall be changed. For this perishable body must put on the imperishable, and this mortal body must put on immortality. When the perishable puts on the imperishable, and the mortal puts on immortality, then shall come to pass a saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory. O death, where is your victory? O death, where is your sting?  
  
I needed to read that. I hope that encouraged you as well. So many people  
  
are falling for this great deception. And it just, it hurts my heart. And I don't know, maybe I'm just venting to y'all. I'm just, to be honest, I haven't even really been eating that much. I cook. I cook a lot. I cook for my son mostly. My four-year-old, actually, I don't think about it. He hasn't been eating that much either. And we don't look like we don't eat. You know, because I love to eat. But, like, I literally cannot...  
  
I love you all thank you so much for listening  
  
and God bless and God bless
