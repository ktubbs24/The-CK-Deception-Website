The thing is, Satan tempts through the lust of the eyes, the lust of the flesh, and the pride of life. When somebody cares about their legacy, they care about their own glory. That is why it is written in the scriptures that we boast in the Lord. When a person boasts of themselves, they are boasting in their own legacy.

The dead know nothing, but at the same time, anybody who doesn't believe in Jesus is still dead in their sins. What did Jesus say? "Let the dead bury the dead." So the living—those who are still on this earth, who are still walking dead in their sins—will worship the dead. I don't care what Charlie Kirk's goal was. Because after watching multiple videos, he did not preach the gospel because he did not know it.

The gospel message is that you must believe that Jesus Christ died on the cross for the forgiveness of our sins, was buried in the tomb for three days, but after the third day he rose from the grave and is at the right hand of the Father in Heaven. Charlie preached a different gospel which was false. We are not to show people the truth and to encourage people to turn to God. Jesus said very clearly that he is the Way, the Truth, and the Life, and that he gives you eyes to see when you believe in him. So only Jesus can show you the truth. We can't do anything.

Also, we don't encourage people to turn to God because it is written in scriptures that somebody who is not saved has a carnal mind. A carnal mind is at war with God and cannot please God. So that means that people cannot turn to God and follow Jesus' lead (by the way, Jesus is God). People can only follow Jesus when they first believe in Jesus. Charlie did not preach this; he preached something else. Charlie was a man of faith, but his faith was in his own efforts, in his own words, and legacy, but his faith was not in Jesus.

Why do you sit here and defend a dead man when you should be out here preaching the gospel? What I have said is what is written in the scriptures. Do as God says to test every spirit to see if it has come from him. Because judgment starts at the house of the Lord first. So anybody who claims to be doing anything in Jesus' name but does so in vain will be called out.
