# 2025-09-17-Charlie Kirk's Legacy is not of God
*because when a man has a legacy he does not boast in the lord he boasts in himself*

Legacy is the pride of life which Satan uses to deceive people with. Your legacy means nothing to God but means much when you live for the praise and validation of man.

Remember his wife said that Turning Point is Charlie’s movement…

Not Jesus’s movement

Not that he was led BY JESUS

REMEMBER Jesus warned how people who reject Him will accept another man coming in HIS OWN NAME…

Don’t be deceived brothers and sisters
