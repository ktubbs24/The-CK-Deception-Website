this is in response to [2025-09-17-Charlie Kirk's Legacy is not of God](/Timeline/Blog/September%202025/17/2025-09-17-Charlie%20Kirk's%20Legacy%20is%20not%20of%20God.md)

yup people are arguing about conspiracies and whatnot and as you know God says not everything is a conspiracy. Even people that are against Him God uses what is meant for evil for his good.

I’m glad you brought that point up because I didnt notice how it’s a sneaky way to bring glory to the flesh to say that “man took Charlie out” when it is Jesus who has the keys of life and death and takes back what belongs to Him.

Thanks for that reminder!!!!

But again, when you focus on Jesus, it's very easy to spot those who are not following him. Because Jesus says, "You will know a tree by the fruit that it bears," and a bad fruit cannot come from a good tree.

To bring this world together? Because if you read the Scriptures, you would know that it is written that the world does not receive Jesus and that Jesus did not come to bring peace, but a sword. Meaning that people who love him, who love the truth, are going to be divided from people who hate the truth. There is no united anything in this world when there are people who love evil and those who love good. It is also written that "how can two walk together unless they be in agreement?" God doesn't need Charlie or any person to bring people back to his faith because it is also written that he draws his sheep to himself. He already does that.

I do agree with you that wokeism and a lot of the talking points of that culture are false. But so is the conservative movement. Nothing of this world, no culture, no politics, no ideology that you will find that comes from this world is good if you try to stick to one part of the world while claiming the rest is evil. You're also claiming to call evil good and good evil because good only comes from above, not from this world, and God does not endorse anything of this world that is an adversity to him. Because he even says the world is an enemy to him.

Stop relying on political figures and human beings to save you; they cannot save you. Jesus says the flesh can do nothing; only believe in Jesus Christ alone love
