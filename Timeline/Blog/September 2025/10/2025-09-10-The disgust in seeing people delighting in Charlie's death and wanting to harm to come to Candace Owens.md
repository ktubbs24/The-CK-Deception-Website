# 2025-09-10-The disgust in seeing people delighting in Charlie's death and wanting to harm to come to Candace Owens

*People reveal how wicked their heart is after Charlie’s assassination.* 

There's sadly a tremendous amount of people who have revealed what is in their hearts about death and murder, and they take pleasure in seeing other people experience the very thing that they delight in, which is death. Many people revealed their true intentions about their neighbor, Charlie Kirk, when many posts on social media went rampant after he was assassinated. 

- People were/are threatening Charlie's wife’s life. 
- People were/are threatening Erika (Charlie’s Wife),
- People were/are threatening the life of Charlie's/Erika’s children, wanting the children to be next. (Ironically, I wouldn't be surprised if these are the same type of people who want to call God evil when God is not evil and sit there to talk about the things that God did to people with wicked hearts in the Old Testament.)
- People were threatening Candace, who was a close friend of Charlie Kirk. 

And the thing is that you do have a lot of people that follow a herd mentality. So if one person is comfortable with saying some gruesome comments (as listed in the screenshot post below), there will be many people who will just follow the lead and also repeat the same thing. But it still showcases how evil that person's heart desires would be because you don't joke about life. You don't joke about things that involve someone taking another person's life or taking their own life, no matter if it's something that's popular that is being spoken or not. So there's still no excuse for this type of behavior and conversation where a mockery was made on the lives of those close to Charlie and Charlie himself.
