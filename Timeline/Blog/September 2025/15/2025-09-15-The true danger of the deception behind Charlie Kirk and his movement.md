# 2025-09-15-The true danger of the deception behind Charlie Kirk and his movement
Don’t fall for the deception of Charlie Kirk and his movement and this is deeper than politics….￼

I hate what happened to Charlie Kirk. The only reason why after today I'm going to be making a lot of posts warning about him and people who heavily believe in him is because the death of Charlie Kirk is a huge DECEPTION, much deeper than politics.

His movement turning point is a phrase for a spiritual revolution, and people are not repenting, and turning to God they’re turning and getting ready to face the antichrist. I’ve been in a lot of deep prayer these last couple of days and fasting and see this clear day. ￼

I noticed this the day he was assassinated, and I wanted to take my time before I said more on it. I hate that people have taken things he said out of context, just like I would hate anybody take anything out of context of someone, whether I agree with them or not.

But after going through a lot of his videos, which I plan on making a lot of commentary on, I hope Charlie believed in Jesus before he was shot. But during his campaign or movement, he had his own agenda.

He was not on Jesus agenda. And I say that to say this. When you've believed in Jesus, he calls you out of this world, and he tells us that we're going to be in the world but not OF it.

Did you see in the scriptures, the disciples or the apostles, engaging in political debates and arguments or did you see them out preaching the gospel of Jesus and focusing only on that? Think about it. ￼

I've already warned in the past about how Christian nationalism is of the anti-Christ spirit. Jesus doesn't call nobody to set up his kingdom or nation for him because Jesus says my kingdom is not of this world

The same antichrist spirit that deceive the Jews, rejected Jesus and who believe that the Messiah that they were going to be waiting for was going to be a ruler and change the Roman empire and make it to where it will be set up for the Jews. Jesus corrected them because he did didn’t come to do that.

That same spirit is in Christian nationalism because through the pride of life you wanna dominate nations what a God say in Genesis that you dominate over the animals not nations or people.

￼This is something that Charlie heavily preached. Both liberal and conservative are still of this world. Both are hypocritical. Both are part of the huge puppet scheme of the devil to people who are still closely associated with it. And Charlie was more focused on American values and politics and conservatism than he was on preaching the gospel of Jesus, which was another thing I noticed.

Like many others, he professes to be Christian but was out here preaching a different gospel. No, you don't get saved by praying the Lord into your heart. No, you don't get saved by getting dipped in the water. No, you don't get saved by a sinner's prayer. Nope, you don't get saved by making Jesus Christ your Lord and Savior, and this is mainly because when you're not saved, you can't save yourself or make Jesus your Lord. That is lordship salvation, which is one of many false teachings and false Gospels. The Gospel message which I have yet to hear Charlie preach after going through so many videos this weekend is that you must believe that Jesus Christ died on the cross for the forgiveness of our sins, was buried in a tomb for three days, but after the third day he rose from the grave and is at the right hand of the Father in heaven. Pay attention: Jesus says, "A friend of the world is an enemy to God." Jesus said, "If the world loves you, it loves his own." Jesus said about people who reject him, "That he comes in the name of the Father, but they don't accept him. But if another man comes in his own name, people who reject Jesus accepts that other man."

Here's the problem: Charlie Kirk, like Martin Luther King, have the appearance of godliness but deny the power of God. Did not preach the gospel of Jesus, and a part of the false prophets that were warned about in these last days. When you have the entire world, including the White House, that is an opposition to Jesus, don't even want to have people speak about Jesus on the news, is out here venerating and putting up the legacy of Charlie Kirk on television.

You got people that call themselves Charlie Kirk. You hear out of the mouth, the heart speaks as Jesus says, "How people said it was Charlie's movement that he started, Turning Point, which I heard him say in another video. He started it at 18. Well, the thing is, is once you say whatever you started before you're saved is no longer going to be what you're going to continue to do. I'm a witness to that in anybody who follows Christ knows that when you're saved, you're not on your own agenda no more because God gives you your purpose and your identity and tells you what you're going to do. You don't have your own movement.

This is about as erroneous and dangerous as when Kanye West came out talking about he was going to start his own church and have his own movement. And I knew even back then when he started that that's not what Jesus says. He ain't following Jesus. He's on his own agenda. Fast forward to today and he's out here denouncing Christ and on his own thing in deep spiritualism and mystical crap. And again, it's not a surprise because the Bible lets us know that when people leave the faith they never belong because if they did they would've remained.

There's a lot of false teachers out here and people think it's only going to be in a religious 4-wall building. Like I said before in the past, no there are a lot of people who are ministers out here who call themselves secular spiritualists and politicians.

If Charlie was of Christ, the world would hate him, not make monuments about him and memorials about him internationally. We also see that his death sparked the results of the works of the flesh: much division is present, strife that is based on fulfilling what God already warned about what happened that nation will be against nation, and that's not talking about countries as talking about ethnicity groups. But when you're following Christ, you preach and warn people that your identity is not the color of your skin or your flesh. Don't fall for the okey-doke or the division. God willing, I'll be posting more coming soon. But you must believe in Jesus Christ, not all this crap that's coming from the world.

Are you going to be right there along with the blind leading the blind? Because all this is as clear as day to us who follow Christ.

That is more than something. That's not right. There's a large amount of people that thought he was Christian, just like there's a large amount of people who think Trump is Christian, and their fruit says the complete opposite. Although I agree on a lot of talking points that both Trump and Charlie Kirk have said, talking points don't mean anything.

Yes, there are people who may be here in the gospel and being prompt to believe in Jesus after this event, but they don’t mean this is a move of God because again just how God says how he uses what is meant for evil for his good. So any opportunity that presents itself for Jesus name to be preached, even with ill intent let it be preached, but we still called the test and see if any spirit has come from God when they’re out here, claiming Jesus name.

I guarantee you if you do what I did you gonna come across the same information I haven’t even started. ￼

An atheist can tell the truth about the truth of God while also not believing in him just as the demons announced, “You are the Son of God!” When they possesed a man and saw Jesus walking towards them…
