# 2025-09-19-Charlie's new follower update on instagram shows how many follow him over following Jesus
*because Jesus said that people that do not accept him will accept another man that comes in his own name and that Jesus sheep do not listen to the voice of a stranger but rather follows only His Voice so this meme is showing how many are following the voice of a dead man over following Jesus who is life and is alive*

Remember those are Charlie’s followers not Jesus…..can’t serve two masters….

Remember there were people who claimed to follow Moses but rejected Jesus. Just go, read the story about the man that was born blind that Jesus healed.

That man has said to the Jews, who rejected Jesus, right before they kicked him out of the synagogue that man said to those Jews, basically, why do you want to know more about Jesus? Do you want to be his disciple too?

Those Jews who rejected Jesus responded saying, “We don’t know this man…we know Moses.”

But remember that Jesus had said to those same Jews that they were liars, hypocrites, and that if they had knew Moses, then they would believe in Him(Jesus).

Jesus was calling out those who pretended to new God who pretended to follow God by claiming to follow a man, but at the same time rejected Jesus

Fast forward to today we see this example happening in probably every generation. You can only be a disciple of one man or one master. ￼If that isn’t Jesus you are following the flesh.

Why do you think social media is set up the way that it is where people are following people and are influenced by people who are leading people to themselves and not leading people to Jesus…. They only get mad that you talk about Jesus so much because they want you to spend all that time to talk about them….

Listen

Jesus says out of the mouth, the heart speaks…

Look at how the antichrist spirit is getting people ready to worship the antichrist who comes in the form of man and who also puts a throne up for himself claiming to be God

Sadly look at how many people are ready…. You can mourn for the loss of Charlie’s life without worshiping the man….￼

Remember how Paul corrected people who were arguing amongst each other trying to boast about who their teacher was or who they were discipled by:

1 Corinthians 1:10-17

10 I appeal to you, brothers and sisters,[a] in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that all of you agree with one another in what you say and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be perfectly united in mind and thought. 11 My brothers and sisters, some from Chloe’s household have informed me that there are quarrels among you. 12 What I mean is this: One of you says, “I follow Paul”; another, “I follow Apollos”; another, “I follow Cephas”; still another, “I follow Christ.”

13 Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Were you baptized in the name of Paul? 14 I thank God that I did not baptize any of you except Crispus and Gaius, 15 so no one can say that you were baptized in my name. 16 (Yes, I also baptized the household of Stephanas; beyond that, I don’t remember if I baptized anyone else.) 17 For Christ did not send me to baptize, but to preach the gospel—not with wisdom and eloquence, lest the cross of Christ be emptied of its powerm
