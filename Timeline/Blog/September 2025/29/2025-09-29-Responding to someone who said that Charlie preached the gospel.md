No, Charlie did not preach the gospel. I have saved a tremendous amount of videos because he is a part of the Great Deception. I was very familiar with Charlie over the years. The type of things that he preached were things that a lot of evangelicals or people within Christianity preach that make up their own gospel that doesn't save.

These are some examples:

- Charlie preached that you must incorporate or support God into your life.
    - That's a false gospel.
- Charlie preached that you must give your life to Christ.
    - That's not the gospel.
- Charlie preached that you must make Jesus your Lord and Savior.
    - Again, that's not the gospel.

The reason why these are not the gospel is because when we are not saved, we are not capable of obeying God or pleasing God. It is written in scripture that the carnal mind is at war with God. It cannot please God. Nor can understand Him beneath the spirit to discern spiritual things.

So how does one get the Spirit of God in order to obey Him? In order to be able to repent of sin in the first place? Well, the gospel in the scriptures that many people are not aware of is that you must believe that Jesus Christ died on the cross for the forgiveness of our sins, was buried in the tomb for three days, but after the third day He rose from the grave and is at the right hand of the Father in heaven. This gospel is the power of God to all who believe they will be saved. And that is how a person will be able to walk in Christ and practice His righteousness, because they believe in Jesus and when you believe in Jesus you receive His Spirit to discern spiritual things.

When you have not believed in Him and you tell people to do a whole bunch of other things that makes it seem like they are pleasing God they are still in their flesh and that's how Satan gets people to continue to perform the works even online the internet has coined it works based salvation, but there is no true salvation that comes from the works of the flesh. The entire time that person will be trying to perform and prove to God that they want Him, but God would have already said in them scriptures that He said to Moses, "it is not by human will or exertion but by Him who gives mercy to whom He pleases" that God has appealed to somebody. God only gives mercy to the one who believes in Him, not to the person who believes in themselves and has accredited their works or their form of coming to Christ as a work that God should accept. See this is not just something that Charlie preached, this is something that the majority of people who claim to be Christian but are not preach. They preach a false gospel and they come in their own name. This is why the world venerates Charlie. This is why people are out here saying "I am Charlie Kirk". This is why people are out here making statues or wanting to make statues of Charlie Kirk in the holidays. Jesus made it very clear, "If the world loves you, it loves its own." This is how the world loves its own, letting you know he did not come in the name of Christ but he is the world's false Messiah or a type of antichrist.

So go and watch them videos, but first go to the Father and do what He says. Test every spirit to see if it has come from Him. I'm telling you this out of love. I ain't out here to debate or argue, which is a work of the flesh. Again, something that Charlie heavily did. You preach the gospel, you give people the truth, you don't try to make people believe the truth, believe the truth.
