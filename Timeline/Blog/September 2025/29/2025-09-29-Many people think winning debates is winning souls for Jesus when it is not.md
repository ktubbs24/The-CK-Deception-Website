*When you’re just trying to chill but someone hands you a Bible like it’s a boxing glove… Jesus wasn’t talking about UFC, bro.*


This is the problem today with people confusing debates and apologetics with preaching the gospel and discipleship.

Many confuse intellect and quick combats with wisdom and fall right into the devil’s trap because many arguments aren’t worth addressing and many are set up in a way with a false premise. You answer to a lie given in question form means you also submit to lies and trying to give reason for the person asking the question.

Why do you think Jesus ignored those who He knew in their heart were murderers and rejected Him but yet asked Him questions?

Why do you think Jesus said not to cast pearls before swine?

He will lead you to give an answer for the hope that is found within you (which is Jesus) when you believe in Him first and not scripts made up by people that actually draws people away from God and leads them into worship of intellectualism and the entire time notice when you watch these debates the gospel Whi his the power of God is NEVER preached.

Jesus even warned through his apostles to not entertain a divisive person that after you have given in the truth, not just once but twice, and they still want to be divisive then you leave them alone. You dust your feet off and you go about your way because we don’t force the truth on people who don’t want the truth.

Charlie￼Kirk an MANY people today have plaigerized the scriptures for their benefit of appearing godly before men but deny the power of God but that’s because they desire the praise of men over the praise of God and that’s why the don’t preach the gospel which is the power of God.

And the gospel message is this that you must believe that Jesus Christ died on the cross, for the forgiveness of our sins, was buried in the tomb for three days, but after the third day, he rose from the grave and is at the right hand of the father in heaven.
