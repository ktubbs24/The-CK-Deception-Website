Exactly. As Jesus said to people who love the devil's desire. You do the desires of the devil. The devil was a murderer from the very beginning. So when you listen to him, you desire the same thing he does. I'm not surprised at the response to what happened yesterday. I'm just mainly disgusted when I know people who try to make excuses.
