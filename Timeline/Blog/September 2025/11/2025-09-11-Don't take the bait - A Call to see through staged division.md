I hate what happened to Charlie Kirk, but you can see it in the Facebook feed and Twitter feed of a lot of people.

You see some people that have turned a martyr into their Messiah. Just like folk did when they turn Martin Luther King into their Messiah. ￼

Then you see other people who are showcasing their hypocrisy and the hatred that they have for people that don't look like them and who they disagree with.

And it is ridiculous because I would even see people call themselves Christian on top of that. And if they were Christian, they would know that Jesus who makes Christian says any man that claims to love their neighbor, but hates them is a liar…. I’m gonna say that again IS A LIAR.￼

No, what God is allowing to happen right now is showcasing that, those who are fake and who are real.

Even in the military, if a person was an infantryman who delighted in killing his opposition or his enemy, if that mentality continued, they would discharge that person or basically say there is something mentally wrong with them or that they need a mental evaluation before returning to duty ￼because you don't delight in somebody dying and being killed regardless if they agree with you or not.

But you have regular civilians who want to justify someone being assassinated whether planned or not because they still live under the lie of their identity being the color of their skin instead of their identity coming from Jesus Christ…
